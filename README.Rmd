The calculator predicts the number of salmon lice in different developmental stages 1 and 2 weeks ahead in a salmonid fish farm. Specifically, it predicts the number of adult female lice per fish, other motile lice per fish and sessile lice per fish. Predictions can be made for each cage in the farm or for the farm average.
