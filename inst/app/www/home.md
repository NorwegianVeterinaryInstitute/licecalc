This is a DEMO of the new version of the salmon lice calculator. Note: Some of the functionality is not implemented yet because of technical issues.

The calculator predicts the number of salmon lice in different developmental stages 1 and 2 weeks ahead in a salmonid fish farm. Specifically, it predicts the number of adult female lice per fish, other motile lice per fish and sessile lice per fish. Predictions can be made for each cage in the farm or for the farm average.

Input data that have to be entered manually are fish weight (kg), fish abundance (1000s) and presence or absence of cleaner fish. 

The following input data can be obtained automatically by entering the 5-digit locality number of the fish farm: this week’s lice counts and sea temperature reported to the Norwegian Food Safety Authority.

The salmon lice calculator is developed as part of the NewTechAqua project with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Programme under grant agreement No 862658.
