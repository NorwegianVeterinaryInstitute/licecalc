To clarify, the farm-level information required for the prediction is:

  farm_id OR inf_pressure and sea_temperature



The cage-level information is:

  adult_females | other_motiles | sessiles | fish_weight | fish_abundance | cleaner_fish



For input file mode, I think it is not needed to have an option to set the infestation pressure manually or to set default values. Then the required fields would be:

  farm_id | adult_females | other_motiles | sessiles | fish_weight | fish_abundance | cleaner_fish



For manual entry mode, I suggest inf_pressure, sea_temperature, fish weight, fish abundance and cleaner_fish are set up with the mean values as default (0 for cleaner_fish). A user would probably not know the infestation pressure of a particular farm. But it might be that a user would like to play with what happens with different levels of infestation pressure, or someone without a specific farm in mind would like to try out the app. Then, if the mean is the default (and visible to the user), it is possible.



For manual entry mode, it may also be useful with an option to obtain farm-level prediction by only providing the farm_id (and possibly fish_weight, fish_abundance and cleaner_fish if different from the default). That is, automatically extracting the farm-level adult_females, other_motiles and sessiles from our files. But if this is time-consuming to set up, I donâ€™t think it has the highest priority.
